    Note on checkout link: it is a good idea to avoid linking to /checkout directly because shops that use 
    Paypal Express Checkout and/or Google Checkout have special checkout buttons on the /cart page. Also,
    special instructions for the seller are entered on the /cart page. Finally, the universal tracking code 
    of Google Analytics may not work if linking directly to the /checkout page.

    It would be nice if the logo was a shop setting, rather than a theme setting.
    But for now, it is a theme setting. The shop logo is uploaded on the theme settings page.
    Link to the theme settings page of currently published theme will always be:
    http://www.shopify.com/admin/themes/current/settings.
    To add theme settings to a theme, see this: http://docs.shopify.com/themes/theme-templates/settings
    Theme settings are added to http://www.shopify.com/admin/themes/current#config/settings.html
